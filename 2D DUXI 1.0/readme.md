# 3D Game Engine with 8-Bit Graphics

This is a lightweight 3D game engine designed for retro-style 8-bit graphics. The engine supports procedural generation, basic physics, and rendering using OpenGL.

## Features
- Procedural terrain generation
- 8-bit graphics aesthetic
- Basic physics and collision
- Audio playback for chiptune music and sound effects

## Build Instructions
1. Install dependencies: OpenGL, GLFW.
2. Run `cmake .` in the project root.
3. Build the project using `make`.

## Current Status
- [ ] Rendering pipeline
- [ ] Procedural generation
- [ ] Physics system
